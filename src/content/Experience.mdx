### Sandbox<span className="text-gray-600 font-light"> @ Northeastern</span>

[Sandbox](https://www.sandboxnu.com/about/) is Northeastern University's student-led software consultancy where we develop 
software for clients from the university community. I've been with the organization since 2022 
and have worked on two development teams—Faculty Activity Tracker and GraduateNU—and have held **project lead** and **developer** roles.


{/* - I am currently leading a group of 7 people (5 developers and 2 designers) to build a full-stack web application for a Northeastern professor and his Merit Committee. 
- This application is a performance review tool to be used for documenting and comparing faculty performance within the Arts and Design department. [*GitHub repo*](https://github.com/sandboxnu/faculty-activity-tracker/) */}

###### January 2023 - December 2023

- Led a rewrite that migrated our codebase from **React** and **NestJS** to **NextJS** because maintaining two standalone applications was too time consuming and slowed down development
- Conducted design and **code reviews** to implement new features, and add documentation to existing
  functionality
- Created and delegated **agile tickets** for developers to prioritize and effectively distribute development tasks
- Had bi-weekly meetings with our professor client to discuss potential features, ask questions on the design and interface and update him on development progress

#### Software Developer <span className="text-gray-600 font-light"> - Faculty Activity Tracker</span>

###### September 2022 - January 2023
- Wrote efficient API routes to perform add and update user, activity and performance on a Postgres database using [**Prisma ORM**](https://www.prisma.io/)
- Led database design meetings to brainstorm and update the database schema and how to implement new fields when new features were required
- Implemented authentication across the frontend and backend using **Auth.js** and **Google Auth** in a Next.js application


### TAMID <span className="text-gray-600 font-light"> @ Northeastern</span>

TAMID is an American national consulting club that connects early-stage startups to university students. I developed for the organization for one semester in 2021.

- My team and I worked with [Presently](https://getpresently.com/), a NY-based startup focused on building end-to-end platforms to make picking and giving gifts easier
- I added animations, tooltips and other visual features to [giftpicker.io](https://giftpicker.io/) (one of Presently's products) by writing new components in their React codebase, for my first deliverable
- I conceptualized and developed a web app that matched users for a "secret santa" style gift exchange, in a team of 15 developers, for my second deliverable
- For this, I wrote backend **serverless functions** that used **k-NN** clustering algorithms which paired users based on a list of common interests

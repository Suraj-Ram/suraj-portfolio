## [Sandbox](https://www.sandboxnu.com/about) <span className="text-gray-600 font-light"> @ Northeastern</span>

- Sandbox is Northeastern's student-led software consultancy where we develop software for clients from the university community
- I am currently leading a group of 7 people (5 developers and 2 designers) to build a full-stack web application for a Northeastern professor and his Merit Committee. 
- This application is a performance review tool to be used for documenting and comparing faculty performance within the Arts and Design department. [*GitHub repo*](https://github.com/sandboxnu/faculty-activity-tracker/)

#### Project Lead

###### January 2023 - Present

- Led a rewrite that migrated our codebase from **React** and **NestJS** to **NextJS** because maintaining two standalone applications was too time consuming and slowed down development
- Conducting design and **code reviews** to implement new features, and add documentation to existing
  functionality
- Create **agile-style tickets** for developers to prioritize and effectively distribute development tasks
- Have bi-weekly meetings with our professor client to discuss potential features, ask him questions on the design and interface and update him on development

#### Software Developer

###### September 2022 - Present
- Wrote efficient API routes to perform add and update user, activity and performance on a Postgres database using [**Prisma ORM**](https://www.prisma.io/)
- Led database design meetings to brainstorm and update the database schema and how to implement new fields when new features were required
- Implemented authentication across the frontend and backend using **Auth.js** and **Google Auth** in a Next.js application

## [TAMID](https://nutamid.org/tech-consulting/) <span className="text-gray-600 font-light"> @ Northeastern</span>

###### December 2021 - May 2022

- TAMID is a national consulting club that connects early-stage startups to university students
- My team and I worked with [Presently](https://getpresently.com/), a NY-based startup focused on building end-to-end platforms to make picking and giving gifts easier
- I added animations, tooltips and other visual features to [giftpicker.io](https://giftpicker.io/) (one of Presently's products) by writing new components in their React codebase, for my first deliverable
- I conceptualized and developed a web app that matched users for a "secret santa" style gift exchange, in a team of 15 developers, for my second deliverable
- For this, I wrote backend **serverless functions** that used **k-NN** clustering algorithms which paired users based on a list of common interests

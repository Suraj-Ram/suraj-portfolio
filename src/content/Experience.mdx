## TAMID <span className="text-gray-600 font-light"> @ Northeastern</span>
###### December 2021 - May 2022
- TAMID is a national consulting club that connects early-stage startups to university students
- My team and I worked with [Presently](https://getpresently.com/), a NY-based startup focused on building end-to-end platforms to make picking and giving gifts easier
- I added animations, tooltips and other visual features to [giftpicker.io](https://giftpicker.io/) (one of Presently's products) by writing new components in their React codebase, for my first deliverable
- I conceptualized and developed a web app that matched users for a "secret santa" style gift exchange, in a team of 15 developers, for my second deliverable
- For this, I wrote backend **serverless functions** that used **k-NN** clustering algorithms which paired users based on a list of common interests

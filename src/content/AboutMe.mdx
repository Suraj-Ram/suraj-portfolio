Hi! I'm a software engineer and a life-long student. I graduated last year from Northeastern with a BS in Computer Science and have been [working at Klaviyo](https://klaviyo.tech/) since. I love wrangling infrastructure and building scalable platforms.

At work, I'm building a extensible sandbox platform to run all of Klaviyo in isolated environments for developer testing and to support highly-personalized sales environments.

Outside of work, I'm [building out my homelab](https://github.com/Suraj-Ram/homelab) to self-host common cloud primitives for personal projects... more coming soon!

Below are my [projects](/projects) and [experiences](/experience) that dive deeper into my interests!

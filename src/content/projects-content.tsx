## [Recreation Tracker](https://github.com/Suraj-Ram/marino-tracker)
###### December 2022
- A web application written in **React** and **Javascript** that tracks the usage across 5 different sections of my crowded university gym, Marino Center.
- Wrote a web scraper that is deployed that scraped [Marino's website](https://recreation.northeastern.edu/) to log sub-hourly usage metrics in a Cloud Firestore document database. Currently at more than 45,000+ documents!
- Created a front end using React and the Recharts graphing library to show daily usage data for each day per gym section.

## [SigLo - Reinvent your input.](https://github.com/AndreyPiterkin/SigLo)
###### February 2022

- A **Python** and **OpenCV** program that controls a computer using gestures captured by the webcam.
- Won most technically challenging product at HackBeanPot 2022 üèÜ.
- Supported gestures for controlling arrow keys, horizontal and vertical scrolling for going through presentations, seeking video playback and simply just scrolling through web pages.
- The program classifies gestures by interpreting 21 key hand landmarks provided by a pre-trained neural network from [**MediaPipe**](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) (a Google-developed computer vision library).
- [Read full listing on Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/siglo)!

## Java Image Editor
###### June 2022
- An image editor written in **Java 8** that applies a variety of filters using matrix operations.
- Utilizes the MVC architecture to decouple the Model, View and Controller.
- The application supports common image types and `.ppm` images.
- Can be interacted with using the GUI (made using **Swing**) and via the console through text inputs
- *Code is private, but can be made public upon request.*

## [AudiNote - Notes with Voice](https://github.com/JosephSalinas/project-13)
###### October 2021
- A minimalist note-taking web app, written in **Javascript**, that transcribes spoken notes using the [**Web Speech API**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API)
- It stores a collection of notes that can be modified in the future and persists them in the LocalStorage.
